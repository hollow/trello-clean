# Trello Clean

A Chrome extension to provide a cleaner Trello experience.

## Features

- The default page zoom level is set to 90% to be able to see more content.
- Most text is removed from header buttons to prevent exceeding the available
  space.
- The `Add List` button is removed to prevent horizontal scrolling if all lanes
  fit into the viewport.
- All badges (except custom fields) are removed from the card front to declutter
  the board.
- Allow the user to collapse lists, courtesy of
